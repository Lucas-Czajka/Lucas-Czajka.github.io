# About

My name is Lucas Czajka, and I am a senior at UC Berkeley, pursuing a major in Data Science with a concentration in Neuroscience, alongside a minor in Industrial Engineering. I am deeply passionate about data science, statistics, and machine learning, and how these disciplines can be leveraged to drive industry innovation.

Throughout my academic journey and various internships, I have gained extensive experience in product analytics. I am dedicated to applying my skills to help organizations better understand their operations, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and implement meaningful changes.

As I prepare to transition into the professional world, I am actively seeking a full-time position as a Data Scientist. I have a particular interest in the biotech and healthcare sectors, where I can combine my expertise in data science with my focus on neuroscience. However, I am also open to opportunities in other industries
